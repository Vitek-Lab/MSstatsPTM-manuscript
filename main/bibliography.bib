abstract = {Defective autophagy is strongly associated with chronic inflammation. Loss-of-function of the core autophagy gene \textit{Atg16l1} increases risk for Crohn’s disease in part by enhancing innate immunity through myeloid cells such as macrophages. However, autophagy is also recognized as a mechanism for clearance of certain intracellular pathogens. These divergent observations prompted a re-evaluation of ATG16L1 in innate antimicrobial immunity. In this study, we found that loss of \textit{Atg16l1} in myeloid cells enhanced the killing of virulent \textit{Shigella flexneri (S.flexneri)}, a clinically relevant enteric bacterium that resides within the cytosol by escaping from membrane-bound compartments. Quantitative multiplexed proteomics of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages revealed that ATG16L1 deficiency significantly upregulated proteins involved in the glutathione-mediated antioxidant response to compensate for elevated oxidative stress, which simultaneously promoted \textit{S.flexneri} killing. Consistent with this, myeloid-specific deletion of \textit{Atg16l1} in mice accelerated bacterial clearance in \textit{vitro} and \textit{in vivo}. Pharmacological induction of oxidative stress through suppression of cysteine import enhanced microbial clearance by macrophages. Conversely, antioxidant treatment of macrophages permitted \textit{S.flexneri} proliferation. These findings demonstrate that control of oxidative stress by ATG16L1 and autophagy regulates antimicrobial immunity against intracellular pathogens.},

    abstract = "{limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.}",
