This indicates that for the peptides that became insignificant in the adjusted model, their change in abundance was mainly due to changes in global protein abundance. Again we tested if the decrease in significant peptides was due to the increased variance that comes from adjustment. This was tested by looking for modified peptides whose adjusted log fold change was within 10\% of the unadjusted log fold change but became insignificant after adjustment. When this test was applied on this experiment, 548 peptides became insignificant due to an increase in variance. This is higher than in {Figure\nobreakspace  {}\G@refundefinedtrue \text  {\normalfont  \bfseries  ??}\GenericWarning  {               }{LaTeX Warning: Reference `fig:ipha_venn_d' on page 21 undefined}}, however it is still a very small portion (3.4\%) of the peptides that became insignificant after adjustment.
